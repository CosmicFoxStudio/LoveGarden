,,,"#33e24d","#873e82","ROSE: But like, all events from the years before would be so horribly bad."
,,,"#a9b855","#694553","ROSE: From the last year to now the students started to take more lead, especially with the rectory kinda leaving the unofficial mega event aside."
,,,"#04dc6d","#064994","PLAYER: So it went from a rectory that did a terrible event to one that doesn’t even do anymore?"
,,,"#99f2b7","#8da1ac","ROSE: More. The old rectory made shitty events and the new one just threw everything into the student's hands to make it."
,,,"#a5a979","#b16dd9","PLAYER: And with students you mean?"
,,,"#13d5c1","#ae88a8","ROSE: Theoretically it should be a lot of people, but no one was willing to manage the events."

,,,"#cff61c","#46dc6b","One male voice, clearly agitated, is speaking loud enough for you to hear even from outside the gazebo."
,,,"#edd405","#6f220a","The voice is really familiar to you..."
,,,"#f39b19","#76e156","???: If it's going to be like this, I really would have preferred not to come at all."

,,,"#009757","#5b24b7","You wait until the girl walks away. Until you can't see more than her silhouette."
,,,"#78c607","#295907","You enter the gazebo and it's not a surprise that one side of the discussion was..."
,,,"#0c182f","#3f9efe","It was Carna. He was seated in one of the seats, his head supported by his hands."
,,,"#25640a","#bbc56c","PLAYER: Hey... Is everything alright?"
,,,"#bdd3a4","#db88c0","A feeling of secondhand embarrassment runs briefly through you while he raises his head in surprise."

,,,"#0553f9","#cc0906","PLAYER: Need a hand?"
,,,"#ae2422","#9f9ab7","CARNA: Nah, you've already helped enough. It's getting late and you need to get back to the dorm before your time goes away."
,,,"#fc635d","#f39841","CARNA: We will see each other tomorrow, sounds good?"
,,,"#08b0e6","#b3245c","You agree, leaving the gazebo."
,,,"#8426e3","#9a28f3","It's better not to get involved in this type of couple fights."
,,,"#af570f","#225da8","PLAYER: (I already heard more than I should, I better just get out of here.)"
,,,"#2c7d9e","#b12406","You turn away to leave, wanting to avoid the person who seemed like they were about to storm out."
,,,"#cb96bf","#301076","However, before you could escape the scene, someone bumps into you."
,,,"#032bd6","#a12d1b","The person who left the gazebo was definitely running."
,,,"#3f62db","#683125","And it's Rose..."
,,,"#99d226","#91f128","You can see in her face a mix of shame and anger."
,,,"#b83148","#68c85a","PLAYER: I-I'm... Sorry, I swear I didn't want to see anything."
,,,"#703d3b","#b48c97","She ponders your words for a few moments."
,,,"#5f489f","#9197ee","ROSE: So you're not telling this to anybody?"
,,,"#6cb8c9","#d4b588","PLAYER: Of course not."
,,,"#14e63c","#15a9c9","She stares at you sternly, probably assessing the truthfulness of your words."
,,,"#dab626","#c0575e","She gives a slight nod, then continues on her way."
,,,"#6e2244","#247caf","Who would've thought a nighttime stroll would land you in this situation..."

,,,"#62eade","#46e259","ROSE: You are new here so you can't even get what I mean."
,,,"#33e24d","#873e82","ROSE: But like, all events from the years before would be so horribly bad."
,,,"#a9b855","#694553","ROSE: From the last year to now the students started to take more lead, especially with the rectory kinda leaving the unofficial mega event aside."
,,,"#04dc6d","#064994","PLAYER: So it went from a rectory that did a terrible event to one that doesn’t even do anymore?"
,,,"#99f2b7","#8da1ac","ROSE: More. The old rectory made shitty events and the new one just threw everything into the student's hands to make it."
,,,"#a5a979","#b16dd9","PLAYER: And with students you mean?"
,,,"#13d5c1","#ae88a8","ROSE: Theoretically it should be a lot of people, but no one was willing to manage the events."

,,,"#63ae53","#ff08ee","ROSE: So it ended up in my hands."
,,,"#4dbc36","#78248f","Have you ever thought about doing less stuff?"
,,,"#fd308a","#f5730a","PLAYER: You will end up depleting yourself easily if you continue like that."

,,,"#70db34","#cbc56b","ROSE: And who knows. Maybe I can convince you to try out one of the events?"
,,,"#3b5d7d","#a926eb","ROSE: Anyways, I found a way to organize my life so as to make everything work."
,,,"#a49d9c","#6a728f","ROSE: And all events till now were a success."

,,,"#03e52d","#8ae1d9","You hoped to finally enjoy the place with no one around."

,,,"#daf406","#f478e0","???: I just really find it hard to trust you with these things!"
,,,"#899c45","#30e211","???: We didn't even enjoy our vacation because you were working."
,,,"#605fb4","#7a4c6a","???: And since we got back, there hasn't been a single date we arranged where you showed up on time!"
,,,"#cff61c","#46dc6b","One male voice, clearly agitated, is speaking loud enough for you to hear even from outside the gazebo."
,,,"#edd405","#6f220a","The voice is really familiar to you..."
,,,"#f39b19","#76e156","???: If it's going to be like this, I really would have preferred not to come at all."
,,,"#c81300","#73f7b4","???: You know I hate to argue!"
,,,"#204d54","#868e33","???: And I won't stay here listening to it!"
,,,"#45b16d","#e9dc26","The female voice exclaims from the gazebo, and you realize she's coming toward you, heading for the entrance."
,,,"#3b2e51","#c3c4b2","What do you do?"
,,,"#2dae56","#c3c4b2","What do you do?"
,,,"#29e295","#d60334","I want to take a peek to understand what's going on."

,,,"#9969f7","#da9446","PLAYER: (And we never know when this kind of situation can escalate, right?)"
,,,"#009757","#5b24b7","You wait until the girl walks away. Until you can't see more than her silhouette."
,,,"#78c607","#295907","You enter the gazebo and it's not a surprise that one side of the discussion was..."
,,,"#0c182f","#3f9efe","It was Carna. He was seated in one of the seats, his head supported by his hands."
,,,"#25640a","#bbc56c","PLAYER: Hey... Is everything alright?"
,,,"#bdd3a4","#db88c0","A feeling of secondhand embarrassment runs briefly through you while he raises his head in surprise."

,,,"#0553f9","#cc0906","PLAYER: Need a hand?"
,,,"#ae2422","#9f9ab7","CARNA: Nah, you've already helped enough. It's getting late and you need to get back to the dorm before your time goes away."
,,,"#fc635d","#f39841","CARNA: We will see each other tomorrow, sounds good?"
,,,"#08b0e6","#b3245c","You agree, leaving the gazebo."
,,,"#8426e3","#9a28f3","It's better not to get involved in this type of couple fights."
,,,"#af570f","#225da8","PLAYER: (I already heard more than I should, I better just get out of here.)"
,,,"#2c7d9e","#b12406","You turn away to leave, wanting to avoid the person who seemed like they were about to storm out."

,,,"#b83148","#68c85a","PLAYER: I-I'm... Sorry, I swear I didn't want to see anything."
,,,"#703d3b","#b48c97","She ponders your words for a few moments."
,,,"#5f489f","#9197ee","ROSE: So you're not telling this to anybody?"
,,,"#6cb8c9","#d4b588","PLAYER: Of course not."
,,,"#14e63c","#15a9c9","She stares at you sternly, probably assessing the truthfulness of your words."
