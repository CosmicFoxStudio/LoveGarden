You wake up in the middle of a bizarre dream about talking mushrooms. #0 #0 #0 #0 #0 #0 #line:d7b82c
It seems your dream alarm didn't go off... #0 #0 #0 #0 #0 #0 #line:6e4123

In a rush, you get ready to leave. #0 #0 #0 #0 #0 #0 #line:0ce9bb
You feel dizzy. #0 #0 #0 #0 #0 #0 #line:3c677a 
You have no idea where you are, or who the hell is Maple... #0 #0 #0 #0 #0 #0 #line:12b01e
I guess instead of questioning the absurdity of it all you just roll with that... #0 #0 #0 #0 #0 #0 #line:2a38ed
