PLAYER: Ugh... #line:ce807b
You wake up in the middle of a bizarre dream about talking mushrooms. #line:d7b82c
It seems your alarm didn't go off... #line:6e4123
Your roommate, Maple, wakes you up. #line:3009e7
<<chara(0, "neutral", "maple")>>
MAPLE: Wow, finally! How can you sleep so much?! #line:79ceda
MAPLE: Not that I'm one to speak... #line:c31ed1
MAPLE: Aren't you supposed to be in class? It's already 8:40... #line:966273
PLAYER: Ahh...! Maple... I'm late! #line:d82166
MAPLE: Well, it's your first day. Ouch. #line:38e002
MAPLE: Not to be the devil on your ear but... #line:32479d
MAPLE: You might as well just skip that class. #line:08cb14
MAPLE: Let's eat some plants and vegetables instead. #line:4acc9c
<<chara(0, "void")>>
In a rush, you get ready to leave. #line:0ce9bb
You feel dizzy. #line:3c677a
You have no idea where you are, or who the hell is Maple... #line:12b01e
I guess, instead of questioning the absurdity of it all, you just roll with that... #line:2a38ed
